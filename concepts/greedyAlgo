Greedy Algorithm

Largest Number in given digits:
_____________________________________
9, 8 , 9 , 6 , 1 

 Correct answer 99861
 we take the max digit and put it first, then we take the second max digit and so on.
 
 Logic:
 every time, we pick the max element.
 then we remove that from the list.
 In the remaining, repeat the max operation in the elements remaining in list.
 keep repeating untill list is empty.
 
 we break the problem into sub problems and for each subprolem we perform the operation.
 
Queue of Patients: 
_____________________________________
 A lot of patients have come at same time, we need to arrange the queue so that the total waiting time is minimum. Doctor can treat only one patient at a time.
 
 1) Make a greedy choise (This needs to be a safe/best choice)
 2) Reduce to a smaller problem
 3) Iterate 
 
 Greedy choice First treat the patient with minimum treatment time. the go on.
 
 MinTotalWaitingTime(t,n)
  waitingTime = 0
  treated <-- array of n zeroes
  for  i from 1 to n:
    tMin = infinity
    minIndex = 0
    for j in 1 to n:
       if treated[i]==0 && t[j]< tMin :
         tMIn = t[j]
         minIndex = j
    waitingTIme = waitingTIme + (n-i) tMin
    treated[minIndex] = 1
   return waitingTime
   
   we have 2 for loops, O(n^2)
   
 Actually, this can be solved in O(n log n)
  we can sort the patients by increasing order of time. 
  each step we pick the first patient. 
 Sort will take  O(n log n) . and finding the wiatingTime for n items takes n. Sototal O(n log n).
